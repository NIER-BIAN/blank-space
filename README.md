# Pokedex

This project is live at https://nier-bian.github.io/pokedex

The Pokedex is a simple web app that displays a list of 150 Pokémons fetched from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). When a Pokémon is clicked, the app fetches the selected Pokémon's details from the API and displays them in a modal.

## Features:

- Data Fetching: Fetches Pokémon data asynchronously using the PokéAPI.
- Dynamic Display: Generates a list of Pokémon buttons dynamically.
- Detailed View: Clicking a Pokémon button shows a modal with its image and details.
- Responsive Design: Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Note:

- This project uses [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to handle vendor prefixes.
- The CSS and JavaScript files have been minimized for optimal performance.
